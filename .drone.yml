# This pipeline runs deploy.sh with a few different ENVIRONMENTs set
# we run them with DRY_RUN=true so they don't do anything
#
# We're essentially checking that deploy.sh finishes with an exit code
# of zero, which will only happen if all accessed environment variables
# are defined correctly
#
# This Drone pipeline doesn't have access to actual kube tokens so there's
# no danger of actually deploying anywhere
